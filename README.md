(a): correspondences generated by correspondence matching strategy (green and red lines represent the inlier and outlier correspondences according to the ground truth respectively). (b) remaining correspondences after using our Outlier Removal Strategy (c) registration result by GROR.

GROR can solve the 6-dof registration problem between two point clouds in 3D. It performs well (fast and robust) even if the input correspondences have an extremely large number of outliers. For more information, please refer to our papers:
